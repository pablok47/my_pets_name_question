# my_pets_name_question

pets = ["Scooby", "Soco", "Summer", "Pixie", "Wilson", "Mason","Baron", "Brinkley", "Bella"]

Write a method to iterate over the array using the each method. If the name starts with an “S”, output the message “My name starts with an S for super!” If the name does not begin with an “S” output the message: “I’m still pretty special too!”.

the name[0] is used to select the first character of the index in an array.  In this case its the first letter "S".  
You are to call the each method on the argument and not on the pets array as it is outside of the method you are creating.
